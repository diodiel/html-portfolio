<hr />

<h3>The Wild Robot</h3>
<p>A very heartfelt movie that demonstrate caring for others even if they are completely different from us.</p>
<h3>Damsel</h3>
<p>Talk about twists. This movie is surprising with lots of unsuspecting turn of events.</p>
<h3>Apocalypto</h3>
<p>Highly recommended. It has nice action scenes and they are very stressful.</p>
